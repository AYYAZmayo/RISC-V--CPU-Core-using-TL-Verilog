# Building a RISC-V-CPU-Core-using-TL-Verilog
# Introduction
Here I am explaining my journey of learning a new language TL-Verilog and building a RSICV-CPU core in a course offered by Linux Foundation on EDX.org platform. I implemented a simple RISC-V (RV32I) based CPU Core and implemented 31 out of the 47 instructions. The following content was taught in this course:

- Digital logic design: This segment served as a refresher for combinational and sequential logic.
- RISC-V (RV32I) ISA: Gained an in-depth understanding of the RISC-V instruction set architecture, which is pivotal in modern processor design and development.
- Basic CPU microarchitecture: The course provided insights into the basic microarchitectural elements of a CPU, enabling me to appreciate the inner workings of a processor.
- Transaction-Level Verilog basics: This section equipped me with the knowledge and skills to describe digital circuits using TL-Verilog, an essential tool for hardware description and design.
- Makerchip online IDE: I learned to utilize Makerchip IDE, an online integrated development environment, for digital design and simulation.
